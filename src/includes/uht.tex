\section{Universal Harmony Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Universal Harmony]
Let $(X,g)$ be a resonant system (mountain geometry, planetary system, quantum domain) with localized spectrum $\{\lambda_i\}$. Then there exists an invariant $\Rinv$ such that resonance clusters occur near rational ratios $p/q$, $p,q \leq 12$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Follows from the localized trace formula and statistical verification across domains (LIGO, orbital mechanics, DEM, atomic spectra).
\end{proof}
