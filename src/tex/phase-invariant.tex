\subsection{Phase Spectral Invariant}

In addition to the resonance invariant $R$, we introduce a phase-type invariant
which naturally emerges in the localized trace formula.

\begin{definition}[Phase Spectral Invariant]
Let $\mathcal{S}(\lambda)$ be the scattering matrix associated with the
Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ describing the geometric background (mountain array,
planetary system, or analogous structure).  
We define
\begin{equation}
  \Theta(\lambda) := \arg \det\!\left(I - \mathcal{S}(\lambda)\right).
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

This quantity measures the global spectral phase shift, capturing how waves
"wrap around" the geometry. The invariant $\Theta(\lambda)$ is stable under
localized perturbations and can be incorporated into the localized trace
formula as a correction term.

\begin{proposition}
For $(M,g)$ with finite volume ends and controlled curvature decay, the pair
$(R,\Theta)$ uniquely characterizes the localized resonance structure of the
Laplace--Beltrami operator.  
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
While $R$ encodes the density and distribution of resonances, $\Theta$ captures
the relative phase alignment. Their combination provides a complete invariant
for stability analysis of resonant systems.
\end{remark}
